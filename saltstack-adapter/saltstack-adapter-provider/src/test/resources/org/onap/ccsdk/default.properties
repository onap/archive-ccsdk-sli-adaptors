#
# The minimum and maximum provider/tenant context pool sizes.  Min=1 means that as soon 
# as the provider/tenant is referenced a Context is opened and added to the pool.  Max=0 
# means that the upper bound on the pool is unbounded. 
org.onap.appc.provider.min.pool=1
org.onap.appc.provider.max.pool=0

#
# The following properties are used to configure the retry logic for connection to the 
# IaaS provider(s).  The retry delay property is the amount of time, in seconds, the
# application waits between retry attempts.  The retry limit is the number of retries
# that are allowed before the request is failed.
org.onap.appc.provider.retry.delay = 30
org.onap.appc.provider.retry.limit = 10

#
# The trusted hosts list for SSL access when a certificate is not provided.
#
provider.trusted.hosts=*
#
# The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a server state change (start->stop, stop->start, etc).
# If the server does not change state to a valid state within the alloted time, the operation 
# fails.
org.onap.appc.server.state.change.timeout=300
#
# The amount of time to wait, in seconds, between subsequent polls to the OpenStack provider 
# to refresh the status of a resource we are waiting on.

#
# The connection information to connect to the provider we are using.  These properties 
# are "structured" properties, in that the name is a compound name, where the nodes 
# of the name can be ordered (1, 2, 3, ...).  All of the properties with the same ordinal
# position are defining the same entity.  For example, provider1.type and provider1.name 
# are defining the same provider, whereas provider2.name and provider2.type are defining
# the values for a different provider.  Any number of providers can be defined in this 
# way. 
#

# Don't change these 2 right now since they are hard coded in the DG
#provider1.type=appc
#provider1.name=appc

#These you can change
#provider1.identity=appc
#provider1.tenant1.name=appc
#provider1.tenant1.userid=appc
#provider1.tenant1.password=appc

# After a change to the provider make sure to recheck these values with an api call to provider1.identity/tokens
